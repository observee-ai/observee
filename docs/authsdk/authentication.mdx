## Auth SDK Setup

### Environment Variable Setup

Set your Observee API key as an environment variable:

```bash
export OBSERVEE_API_KEY="obs_your_api_key_here"
```

## OAuth Authentication Flow

### Step 1: Authenticate with a Service

Use the Auth SDK to authenticate with services like Gmail, Slack, etc. and get a client_id:

<CodeGroup>

```python Python
from observee_agents import call_mcpauth_login, get_available_servers

# See available services
servers = get_available_servers()
print(f"Available: {servers['supported_servers']}")

# Start authentication (optionally provide your own client_id)
response = call_mcpauth_login(
    auth_server="gmail",
    client_id="<client_id (uuid)>"  # Optional: use your own UUID
)
print(f"Visit: {response['url']}")

# After authentication, you'll receive:
# {"success":true,"client_id":"<client_id (uuid)>"}
```


```typescript TypeScript
import { callMcpauthLogin, getAvailableServers } from "@observee/agents";

// See available services
const servers = await getAvailableServers();
console.log(`Available: ${servers.supported_servers}`);

// Start authentication (optionally provide your own client_id)
const response = await callMcpAuthLogin({
    authServer: "gmail",
    clientId: "<client_id (uuid)>"  // Optional: use your own UUID
});
console.log(`Visit: ${response.url}`);

// After authentication, you'll receive:
// {"success":true,"client_id":"<client_id (uuid)>"}
```

</CodeGroup>

### Step 2: Use the Client ID

After authentication, use the returned client_id in your API calls. **Tools are automatically filtered based on which services you've authenticated with this client_id.**

<Note>
  **Important:** You can reuse the same client_id to authenticate multiple services. Each time you authenticate a new service with an existing client_id, that client_id gains access to the new service's tools while retaining access to previously authenticated services.
</Note>

<CodeGroup>

```python Python
from observee_agents import chat_with_tools

# Use the client_id from authentication
# Only Gmail tools will be available since we authenticated Gmail
result = chat_with_tools(
    message="Check my Gmail inbox and summarize important emails",
    provider="anthropic",
    client_id="<client_id (uuid)>"  # From Step 1
)
```


```typescript TypeScript
import { chatWithTools } from "@observee/agents";

// Use the client_id from authentication
// Only Gmail tools will be available since we authenticated Gmail
const result = await chatWithTools("Check my Gmail inbox and summarize important emails", {
    provider: "anthropic",
    clientId: "<client_id (uuid)>"  // From Step 1
});
```

</CodeGroup>

## Available Services

50\+ services are supported including:

- **Email & Calendar**: Gmail, Google Calendar, Outlook
- **Productivity**: Google Docs, Google Sheets, Google Drive, OneDrive
- **Project Management**: Linear, Asana, Jira (Atlassian)
- **Communication**: Slack, Discord
- **Knowledge**: Notion, Airtable
- **Development**: GitHub, Supabase
- **And many more...**

### Check Authenticated Services

You can check which services are authenticated for a specific client_id:

<CodeGroup>

```python Python
from observee_agents import get_servers_by_client

# Check which services this client_id has access to
authenticated = get_servers_by_client(
    client_id="<client_id (uuid)>"
)
print(f"Authenticated services: {authenticated['servers']}")
# Output: {"servers": ["gmail", "slack"]}
```


```typescript TypeScript
import { getServersByClient } from "@observee/agents";

// Check which services this client_id has access to
const authenticated = await getServersByClient({
    clientId: "<client_id (uuid)>"
});
console.log(`Authenticated services: ${authenticated.servers}`);
// Output: {"servers": ["gmail", "slack"]}
```

</CodeGroup>

## Multiple Service Authentication

**You can reuse the same client_id to authenticate multiple services.** This allows you to access tools from different services with a single client_id:

<CodeGroup>

```python Python
# Option 1: Use the same client_id for multiple services
my_client_id = "<client_id (uuid)>"

# Authenticate Gmail
gmail_response = call_mcpauth_login(
    auth_server="gmail",
    client_id=my_client_id
)

# Authenticate Slack with the SAME client_id
slack_response = call_mcpauth_login(
    auth_server="slack", 
    client_id=my_client_id  # Reusing the same client_id
)

# Now this client_id has access to both Gmail AND Slack tools
result = chat_with_tools(
    message="Check my emails and post a summary to Slack",
    client_id=my_client_id  # Can use both services!
)

# Option 2: Use different client_ids for separate sessions
# (Each client_id will only have access to its own authenticated services)
```


```typescript TypeScript
// Option 1: Use the same client_id for multiple services
const myClientId = "<client_id (uuid)>";

// Authenticate Gmail
const gmailResponse = await callMcpAuthLogin({
    authServer: "gmail",
    clientId: myClientId
});

// Authenticate Slack with the SAME client_id
const slackResponse = await callMcpAuthLogin({
    authServer: "slack",
    clientId: myClientId  // Reusing the same client_id
});

// Now this client_id has access to both Gmail AND Slack tools
const result = await chatWithTools("Check my emails and post a summary to Slack", {
    clientId: myClientId  // Can use both services!
});

// Option 2: Use different client_ids for separate sessions
// (Each client_id will only have access to its own authenticated services)
```

</CodeGroup>

## Troubleshooting

**Invalid API Key**: Check your key starts with `obs_`

**OAuth Failed**: Make sure you completed the authentication flow in your browser

**Permission Denied**: Check that you've authenticated the service for this client_id

**Tool Not Found**: Ensure you've authenticated with the correct service
